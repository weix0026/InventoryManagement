# InventoryManagement
A sample average approximation based mixed linear integer programming model for biomass inventory control

In order to run the code, you also need to install cplex on your computer and setup the python environment to run cplex. Note that I am using cplex callable library instead of the other cplex libraries to achieve the maximum flexibility. 


A reference site for installing and running cplex. https://www.pythonpool.com/cplex-python/
https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/icos/20.1.0?topic=cplex-setting-up-python-api

1. open the python from ArcGIS command terminal as administrator
2. change to the directory cplex is installed: C:\Program Files\IBM\ILOG\CPLEX_Studio221\python
3. run the python install function for CPLEX, as "python setup.py install"
4. go to the folder for the actual code C:\Users\yweim\OneDrive - Colostate\IM\python
5. run jupyter notebook
